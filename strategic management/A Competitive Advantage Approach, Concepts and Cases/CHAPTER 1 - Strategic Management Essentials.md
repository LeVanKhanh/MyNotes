## Key Terms in Strategic Management

- Competitive advantage: This term can be defined as any activity a firm does especially well compared to activities done by rival firms, or any resource a firm possesses that rival firms desire
- Strategists: are the individuals most responsible for the success or failure of an organization
- Vision and mission statements: Vision statement that answers the question “What do we want to become?” Mission statements are “enduring statements of purpose that distinguish one business from other similar firms.
- External opportunities and threats: External opportunities and external threats refer to economic, social, cultural, demographic, environmental, political, legal, governmental, technological, and competitive trends and events that could significantly benefit or harm an organization in the future
- Internal strengths and weaknesses: Internal strengths and internal weaknesses are an organization’s controllable activities that are performed especially well or poorly. They arise in the management, marketing, finance/ accounting, production/operations, research and development, and management information systems (MIS) activities of a business.
- Long-term objectives: Objectives can be defined as specific results that an organization seeks to achieve in pursuing its basic mission. Long-term means more than one year.
- Strategies: Strategies are the means by which long-term objectives will be achieved. Business strategies may include geographic expansion, diversification, acquisition, product development, market penetration, retrenchment, divestiture, liquidation, and joint ventures.
- Annual objectives: Annual objectives are short-term milestones that organizations must achieve to reach longterm objectives. Like long-term objectives, annual objectives should be measurable, quantitative, challenging, realistic, consistent, and prioritized. They must also be established at the corporate, divisional, and functional levels in a large organization. Annual objectives should be stated in terms of management, marketing, finance/accounting, production/operations, R&D, and MIS accomplishments. 
- Policies: Policies are the means by which annual objectives will be achieved. Policies include guidelines, rules, and procedures established to support efforts to achieve stated objectives. Policies are guides to decision making and address repetitive or recurring situations.

## Practice
To work on the Vision & Mission Statements of the assigned company and propose the new Mission Statement as well as the followings:

A.	Introduce the Company. How did the corporation perform in the past year overall in terms of return on investment, market share, and profitability?

B.	Strategic Posture What are the corporation’s current mission, objectives, strategies, and policies?

1. Are they clearly stated, or are they merely implied from performance?

2. Mission: What business(es) is the corporation in? Why? 
3. Objectives: What are the corporate, business, and functional objectives? Are they consistent with each other, with the mission, and with the internal and external environments?
4. Strategies: What strategy or mix of strategies is the corporation following? Are they consistent with each other, with the mission and objectives, and with the internal and external environments? 
5. Policies: What are the corporation’s policies? Are they consistent with each other, with the mission, objectives, and strategies, and with the internal and external environments? 
6. Do the current mission, objectives, strategies, and policies reflect the corporation’s international operations, whether global or multidomestic?
