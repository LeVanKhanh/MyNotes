# CHAPTER 6 - The internal audit

Strengths that cannot be easily matched or imitated by competitors are called **distinctive competencies**.

## The Process of Gaining Competitive Advantage in a Firm
Weaknesses => Strenghts => Distinctive Competencies => Competitive Advantage

## Integrating Strategy and Culture
Organizational culture is “a pattern of behavior that has been developed by an organization as it learns to cope with its problem of external adaptation and internal integration, and that has worked well enough to be considered valid and to be taught to new members as the correct way
to perceive, think, and feel.”

cultural products include values, beliefs, rites, rituals, ceremonies, myths, stories, legends, sagas, language, metaphors, symbols, folktales, and heroes and heroines.
