# Which domain are you making your decision in?
- Obvious: Obvious contexts are characterized by stability and cause-and-effect relationships that are clear to everyone.
- Complicated: Complicated contexts may contain multiple right answers, and though there is a clear relationship between
cause and effect, not everyone can see it.
- Complex: In complex contexts, the right answers can’t be figured out beforehand simply because it has not happened
this way before
- Chaotic: In chaotic contexts, searching for the right answers is pointless.
# Six biases that can derail your decision
- Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, focus on and remember information that confirms your existing beliefs. This can lead you to miss relevant information.
- Anchoring bias: When you rely too heavily on one trait or piece of information. Often something that comes up early in the process, think of it as a “first impression” bias that you anchor in.
- Overconfidence bias: This happens when you put too much faith in your own knowledge, experiences and opinions. It may also lead you to think your contribution is more important than it actually is.
- Availability bias: The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of an event occurring again because you remember it clearly from last time it happened. It is easily available in your mind because it was recent, unusual or emotionally charged.
- Bandwagon bias: This is similar to so-called groupthink. It means you are more likely to form an opinion or take an action because other people around you have already done so. You hop on the bandwagon so to speak.
