# Three main reasons for delegation
- Your team will reach better results
- It will lessen your own burden and allow you to use
more of your time for important strategic work
- It helps other people grow

# Which tasks to delegate
- Low effort - High skill: 
These are tasks you should consider doing yourself. They
require little effort but a high skill and could be a good
investment of your time. 

- High effort - High skill:
These kinds of tasks are well suited for a longer project.
You delegate them to one or more people with a high skill
or who can acquire that skill with training or support.
Initially these projects will likely require plenty of your
time but in the long term people will become more independent. Meaning you will be able to delegate these tasks
more effectively and free up more of your time. 

- Low effort - Low skill:
These are tasks you want to make sure to definitely delegate. You will have a bigger pool of people to choose from as they require low skill. Getting stuck with these tasks on your own to-do list as a huge efficiency killer and waste of your time. 

- Hight effort - Low skill: 
Delegate these tasks as often as possible to somebody with a lower competence level. They can be good stepping stones for you to practice your delegation skills. And for the person you are delegating to, they can be stepping stones to working more independently and effectively.

# Four questions
- Is there somebody else on your team that has or can be given the required knowledge or experience to complete the task?
- Does the task at hand offer an opportunity for another person to grow and develop their skills?
- Will this task recur in the future? Either in this form or a similar form?
- Can you create the time to delegate the task in an effective way? This includes time for training, support in the form of questions and answers, checking in on progress and giving feedback when needed

# Who to delegate to
- Competence level
- Current work load
- Level of independence and ambitions
Keep in mind that when you first start delegating to a person he or she may take longer than you would to
complete the task at hand.

# The five steps of effective delegation
- Specify outcome
- Guidelines (framework)
- Resources
- Evaluation/ monitoring
- Feedback/ recognition

# The four delegation styles
- Instruct: This style is best used with a person with a low skill for the specific task. Their will may be high, they may
be enthusiastic, but their skill is low. 
- Train: This style is best used with a person that has some more skill for the task at hand. Their will might be lower
but their knowledge and experience is stronger. 
- Coach: This style is best used with a person with a higher competence for the given task. 
- Monitor: This style is best used with a person on the highest competence level. Their skill is strong and their will too. Let your team members decide how the task should be solved, give them freedom to find their own ways.Delegate only results, not methods. Specify what you want done, not how to do it.
