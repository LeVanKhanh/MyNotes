# The four level of communication

- **Nothing**: The first level is when we talk about Nothing. This is the first and shallowest level of communication. A common topic on this level is talking about the weather. It means we are talking about nothing, something
- **Something**: The second level of communication is where we talk about Something. And something in this case can be our favorite sports team. It can be about the organizational chart. It can be about the meeting yesterday or about the new computer system. We talk about something on this second level of communication which is slightly deeper than the first level. It says a bit more about the persons engaged in the communication, but it is still not a very deep level of communication
- **Somebody**: The third level of communication is when we talk about Somebody. Now we’re getting down to a bit of a deeper level, a more direct level of communication. Somebody means we are talking about somebody who is not in the communication, not in the conversation. We could for example be talking about the boss, if he or she is not present. We could be talking about another coworker or about our kids.
- **You and I**:The fourth and deepest, most direct level of communication is called You and I. This is where we talk about you and I. Feedback for example, ends up on this level. When I give you feedback or you give me feedback. It’s a very direct, effective communication when we want to develop a relationship and deepen an interaction with another person.

# Having a clear outcome
- **Something easily gets missed**: Sometimes people go into a conversation and they have no idea what they want out of it
- **To be an effective communicator**: Make your desired outcome crystal clear for yourself and watch your communication skills improve along with it.

# The arrow of credibility
- **Step 1: Sensation** Meaning something you experience with your five senses. You smell, touch, see and so forth. You have some sort of sensation somewhere in your body. 
- **Step 2: Awareness** In the second step, you can choose to become aware of that “oh, I have a pressure in my stomach” or you might not.
- **Step 3: Insight** Maybe I’m having too much to do at work.” That could be one example of an insight in step three.
- **Step 4: Action** 
- **Step 5: Effect** To really be the one who increases the chances of other people trusting you or perceiving you as a credible person, you also need to take responsibility for the effects that your actions are having

# Confict Management
## Incompatible Strategies
## The five confict styles
- Fight: In a conflict situation if I prioritize my needs first, or my goals, then I would most likely choose the first conflict style which is called to fight.
- Adapt: On the other hand if I choose a style that focuses completely on the needs of the other person or persons then I choose the style called to adapt. Meaning I forgo my own needs and instead focus on the other person’s needs.
- Avoid: I could also choose to not focus on neither my needs or the needs of the other person. In that case I would choose to simply avoid the conflict. The third style is therefore called to avoid. 
- Compromise: The fourth style is if I make sure I get it a little bit the way I want it, while also making sure other people get a little bit of what they want and need. Then we have a style called to compromise. Compromise often feels like I get a little bit of what I want, but not completely what I really wanted
- Cooperate: The fifth style is when I make sure to fulfill both my needs and the needs of the other person or persons involved. This is called to cooperate. I achieve my goals, the things I want and need, while I also prioritize the relationship and meeting the other person’s needs.
