# The four level of communication

- **Nothing**: The first level is when we talk about Nothing. This is the first and shallowest level of communication. A common topic on this level is talking about the weather. It means we are talking about nothing, something
- **Something**: The second level of communication is where we talk about Something. And something in this case can be our favorite sports team. It can be about the organizational chart. It can be about the meeting yesterday or about the new computer system. We talk about something on this second level of communication which is slightly deeper than the first level. It says a bit more about the persons engaged in the communication, but it is still not a very deep level of communication
- **Somebody**: The third level of communication is when we talk about Somebody. Now we’re getting down to a bit of a deeper level, a more direct level of communication. Somebody means we are talking about somebody who is not in the communication, not in the conversation. We could for example be talking about the boss, if he or she is not present. We could be talking about another coworker or about our kids.
- **You and I**:The fourth and deepest, most direct level of communication is called You and I. This is where we talk about you and I. Feedback for example, ends up on this level. When I give you feedback or you give me feedback. It’s a very direct, effective communication when we want to develop a relationship and deepen an interaction with another person.
