# Tips for effective coaching
- Ask open questions
- Ask “how”-questions, avoid “why”-questions: How-questions are more creative and forward focused. Why-questions easily lead to a historical focus on guilt or blame.???????
- Set your own thoughts aside: Be neutral and focus on exploring and understanding the other person’s map of the world
- Be genuinely interested in the other person 
- Get your intention where it needs to be
- Paraphrase
- If the other person gets stuck it can be useful to offer suggestions
- Find their own suggestions
- Pay attention to the other person’s body language (and your own)
- Set timeframes
