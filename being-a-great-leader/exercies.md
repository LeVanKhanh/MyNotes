# The difference between management and leaderships
- **Assess Your Co-Workers** Which ones of your co-workers belong to those who tend to focus more on Things or Experiences? How can you behave towards both those categories of people to treat them with more respect?

- **Assess Your Organization** What about your organization? Is there more of a focus on the Things dimension when working on different tasks? More focus on the Experiences dimension? Or a good balance? 

- **Assess Your Decision-Making** When you make decisions, which of the two dimensions do you tend to focus more on? Is there something in your leadership that you would like to change to make decisions that work better for everyone involved?


# Feed back 
- A Different Expression: Think about a situation that did not go as you would have expected. Looking back, how could you have expressed yourself to the other person with the starting point being yourself and your experience of the situation? Write down three different phrases that you could have used as if you were saying them directly to the person.

- The Communication at Your Workplace: Is there an open field of communication at your workplace, where the co-workers feel like they have the possibility to give feedback to their colleagues or to you as a manager? If not, how can you create it? Write down five ideas for how you could improve the climate for giving feedback at your workplace.

- How You React: Reflect on how you usually react when you as a leader receive feedback from co-workers. Which step of the Feedback Staircase are you habitually on? Is there another step that would be more productive to use? If yes, what do you need to do to make that change?

# Communication
- **Hiding Behind Words** Think about what words you as a leader tend to hide behind when writing emails or talking to your co-workers? Whenever you notice that you use words like “they", "we", "the organization", "the club”, stop for a moment and see if you can exchange those words for one that shows who is actually behind the statement. It can be scary in the beginning, but eventually your confidence will grow from being able to actually stand for what you say.

- **Acknowledging All Your Co-Workers** How much time and attention do you give to every individual co-worker? Are all your co-workers acknowledged or is it mainly the ones who take up more space, verbally or non-verbally, that get more attention? Do you take the time to listen with your full attention when someone wants to talk?

- **Having a Clear Outcome** When you plan your meetings and co-worker conversations, do you usually have a clear goal or outcome in mind? How can you use the concept of having a clear outcome before your next meeting? What feeling do you want to leave the meeting with – and what feeling do you think the co-worker wants to have? Is it the same feeling?

- **Your Focus** When someone speaks, what focus do you normally have? Do you do something else simultaneously; type on your computer, fill up coffee, daydream or plan what your response will be? How much of your attention do you usually give the other person?
