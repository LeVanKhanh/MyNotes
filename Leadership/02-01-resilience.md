- Resilience originates from the Latin word resiliens, which refers to the pliant or elastic quality of a substance (R. R. Greene et al., 2002).

- Masten (2005) defines resilience as a class of phenomena characterized by good outcomes in spite of serious threats to adaptation of development.

- Rutter (1987), a psychiatric risk researcher, states that the term is used to describe the positive tone of individual differences in people’s response to stress and adversity.

- Janas (2002) identified the term as the ability to bounce back from adversity, frustration, and misfortune. 

- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2015) defines resilience as the ability of people to withstand, adapt to, and recover from adversity and stress. People will reveal resilience by maintaining or returning to their original state of mental health or wellbeing through the use of effective coping strategies.

- Resilience is also used interchangeably with positive coping, adaptation, and persistence (R. R. Greene et al., 2002).

- In essence, resilience researchers agree that resilience is concerned with individual variations in response to risk. While some individuals succumb to stress and adversity, others survive and respond well to the challenges associated with life’s hazards (Rutter, 1987).

# Resilience & Disciplines

- **Psychology**: The ability to bounce back and to withstand by repairing oneself (Higgins, 1994; Wolin & Wolin, 1993)

- **Psychiatry**: The psychological and biological strengths humans use to master change successfully (Flach, 1988)

- **Developmental Psychopathology**: The ability to cope with challenges and threats while maintaining an internal and integrated sense of self (Garmezy & Masten, 1986)

- **Human Development**: he ability to withstand or successfully cope with adversity (Werner & Smith, 2001)

- **Change Management**: The ability to demonstrate both strength and flexibility during the change process, while displaying minimal dysfunctional behavior (Connor, 1993)

- **Medicine**: The ability to recognize pain, acknowledge its purpose, tolerate it for a while, until things begin to normalize (Flach, 1988; O’Leary & Ickovics, 1995)

- **Epidemiology**: The ability to survive stress and to rise above disadvantage (Rutter, 1979)

- **Nursing**: The ability to regenerate power to respond to the internal or external environment for survival, growth, or development (Jones, 1991)

- **Social Sciences**: The ability to recover from negative life experiences and become stronger while overcoming them (Henderson & Milstein, 1996)

# Resilience Theory

- Today, we will use the definition that resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity, frustration, and misfortune and is essential for the effective leader.

- The literature on this subject demonstrates that there is a direct relationship between the stress of the leader’s job and their ability to maintain resilience in the face of prolonged contact with adversity.

- **Four Phase Resilience Cycle**: A deteriorating phase, An adapting phase, A recovery phase, A growing phase.

# Thriving
Thriving is grounded on an individual's positive transformation resulting from the experience of adversity.
(Nishiwaka, 2006)

- People will respond to thriving in three different ways when confronted by a challenge: Survive the incident, Recover from the incident, Thrive as a result of enduring the hardship. (Nishikawa, 2006)

- We thrive when we surpass and transcend our prior level of functioning, regain and even accelerate our upward psychological trajectory, and seem to have mentally and emotionally benefited from our suffering. Because of our crisis, we seem to begin to flourish. (Pearsall, 2003, p. 17)

# Hardiness
Hardiness is synonymous with thriving but embraces an individual's ability to make the best of difficult circumstances.

Bonanno (2004) has identified three dimensions to hardiness: Being Committed to finding meaningful purpose in life, the belief that one can influence one’s surrounding and the outcome of events, the belief that one can learn and grow from both positive and negative life experiences

# Variables of Resilience
The literature addressing the concepts of resilience and thriving does so in the context of internal and external factors that contribute to an individual's ability to thrive.

- **Internal Variables of Resilience**: Internal variables of resilience are defined as self-factors, personality factors, or individual resources. These factors appear to have significant impact on how a person interprets and deals with the crisis at hand. These factors may include hardiness, coping ability, a sense of coherence, the use of personal resources, cognitive resources, threat appraisal, and self-efficacy.(O’Leary, 1998)

- Beardslee’s Variables (1989): Temperaments (i.e., modes of thought), Response, Action, Positive self-esteem, A sense of being effectual, Being in control of one’s surroundings

- Ungar’s Variables (2004): Optimism, Empathy, Insight, Intellectual competence, Direction or mission, Determination and perseverance

- **External Variables of Resilience**: 
External variables have influence over a person's ability to remain resilient in the face of adversity.
Of the external variables defined, the most compelling and most consistent finding indicates the centrality of relationships as a critical component to resilience.(Beardslee, 1989; Masten, 2005; O’Leary, 1998)

# 10 Ways to Build Resilience:
The key is to identify ways that are likely to work well for you as part of your own personal strategy for fostering resilience.

- **Make connections**: Good relationships with close family members, friends or others are important. Accepting help and support from those who care about you and will listen to you strengthens resilience. Some people find that being active in civic groups, faith-based organizations, or other local groups provides social support and can help with reclaiming hope. Assisting others in their time of need also can benefit the helper.

- **Avoid seeing crises as insurmountable problems**: You can't change the fact that highly stressful events happen, but you can change how you interpret and respond to these events. Try looking beyond the present to how future circumstances may be a little better. Note any subtle ways in which you might already feel somewhat better as you deal with difficult situations.

- **Accept that change is a part of living**: Certain goals may no longer be attainable as a result of adverse situations. Accepting circumstances that cannot be changed can help you focus on circumstances that you can alter.

- **Move toward your goals**: Develop some realistic goals. Do something regularly — even if it seems like a small accomplishment — that enables you to move toward your goals. Instead of focusing on tasks that seem unachievable, ask yourself, "What's one thing I know I can accomplish today that helps me move in the direction I want to go?"

- **Take decisive actions**: Act on adverse situations as much as you can. Take decisive actions, rather than detaching completely from problems and stresses and wishing they would just go away.

- **Look for opportunities for self-discovery**: People often learn something about themselves and may find that they have grown in some respect as a result of their struggle with loss. Many people who have experienced tragedies and hardship have reported better relationships, greater sense of strength even while feeling vulnerable, increased sense of self-worth, a more developed spirituality and heightened appreciation for life.

- **Nurture a positive view of yourself**: Developing confidence in your ability to solve problems and trusting your instincts helps build resilience.

- **Keep things in perspective**: Even when facing very painful events, try to consider the stressful situation in a broader context and keep a long-term perspective. Avoid blowing the event out of proportion.

- **Maintain a hopeful outlook**: An optimistic outlook enables you to expect that good things will happen in your life. Try visualizing what you want, rather than worrying about what you fear.

- **Take care of yourself**: Pay attention to your own needs and feelings. Engage in activities that you enjoy and find relaxing. Exercise regularly. Taking care of yourself helps to keep your mind and body primed to deal with situations that require resilience.

- **Additional ways of strengthening resilience may be helpful**: For example, some people write about their deepest thoughts and feelings related to trauma or other stressful events in their life. Meditation and spiritual practices help some people build connections and restore hope.
